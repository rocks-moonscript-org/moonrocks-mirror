    Structured Event-Driven Concurrency for Lua
   ]],
   detailed = [[
    Atmos is a programming library for Lua that reconciles *Structured
    Concurrency*, *Event-Driven Programming*, and
    *Functional Streams*, extending classical structured programming
    with three main functionalities:

    - Structured Deterministic Concurrency:
        - A `task` primitive with deterministic scheduling provides predictable
          behavior and safe abortion.
        - Structured primitives compose concurrent tasks with lexical scope (e.g.,
          `watching`, `every`, `par_or`).
        - A `tasks` container primitive holds attached tasks and control their
          lifecycle.
    - Event Signaling Mechanisms:
        - An `await` primitive suspends a task and wait for events.
        - An `emit` primitive signal events and awake awaiting tasks.
    - Functional Streams (à la ReactiveX):
        - Functional combinators for lazy (infinite) lists.
        - Interoperability with tasks & events:
            tasks and events as streams, and
            streams as events.
        - Safe finalization of stateful (task-based) streams.

    Atmos is inspired by synchronous programming languages like Céu
    and Esterel.

icecream.lua enhances print debugging by providing more informative and visually appealing output.
Use ic() just like you would use print() for debugging.

Features:
- Automatically includes the expressions and their values.
- Provides contextual information to help you locate where the print statement was called.
- Outputs are designed to be easily readable, reducing the cognitive load during debugging.

    The Programming Language Atmos
   ]],
   detailed = [[
    Atmos is a programming language that reconciles Structured
    Concurrency and Event-Driven Programming, extending classical
    structured programming with two main functionalities:

    - Structured Deterministic Concurrency:
        - A `task` primitive with deterministic scheduling provides predictable
          behavior and safe abortion.
        - A `tasks` container primitive holds attached tasks and controls their
          lifecycle.
        - A `pin` declaration attaches a task or tasks to its enclosing lexical
          scope.
        - Structured primitives (e.g., `par`) compose concurrent tasks with
          lexical scope.
    - Event Signaling Mechanisms:
        - An `await` primitive suspends a task and waits for events.
        - An `emit` primitive signals events and awakes awaiting tasks.

    Atmos also complements its core synchronous concurrency model with
    Functional Streams (à la ReactiveX) and Multithreading Parallelism
    (via LuaLanes):

    - Functional Streams:
        - Interoperability with tasks & events.
        - Safe finalization of stateful streams.
    - Asynchronous Parallelism:
        - A `thread` primitive offloads computations to isolated OS threads.
        - Safe abortion and finalization for threads.

    Atmos compiles to Lua and relies on lua-atmos for its
    concurrency runtime.

    Atmos is inspired by synchronous programming languages like Céu
    and Esterel.

      OpenCV bindings for luajit and lua 5.1/5.2/5.3/5.4.

      Linux/Windows users:
      I recommend you to try installing the prebuilt binary with
      luarocks install --server=https://github.com/smbape/lua-opencv/releases/download/v0.0.2 opencv_lua

      If the prebuilt binary does not work, then I recommend to host your own binary rocks by following the instructions at
      https://github.com/smbape/lua-opencv/tree/v0.0.2#hosting-you-own-binary-rocks

      Otherwise, follow the instructions at https://github.com/smbape/lua-opencv/tree/v0.0.2#prerequisites-to-source-rock-install
      before attempting to install the source rock.
